An example to familiarize yourselves with linear classification, particularly the logistic regression through implementing and applying the classifier on a real data set, on which you may have to perform feature scaling, and with analysis of error history.
You can check <hw2.pdf> for the given problem set and see results of objective function and accuracy results for training and validation sets for different learning rates(low,mid, high).
